# Library-of-knowledge
This repository is dedicated to sharing educational materials.
This repository has some books which are quite easy to find with a google search, and also has some books which are
harder to obtain. Big companies like Pearson may charge up to $60 for a PDF file of their most famous textbooks, but here
you can read some of them for free.
I also have some books which were too big to upload here. You can email me at arthur.kainan.wu@gmail.com if you want a
PDF copy.

Hughes Calculus (Multivariable)/
Not sure on its reputation, but one of Hughes' books was used in Stanford's introductory Calculus course sequence, so I believe she's a good author.

William Boyce Differential Equations/
Good for Ordinary Differential Equations. What George Mason uses for their Ordinary Differential Equations course, I believe.

So far, I've only read a bit of Campbell's, so all my reviews here are mostly copying off what others said. I hope you find something useful here.
