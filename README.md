# Library-of-knowledge
This repository is dedicated to sharing educational materials.
This repository has some books which are relatively easy to find with a google search, and also has some books which are
harder to obtain. Big companies like Pearson may charge up to $60 for a PDF file of their most famous textbooks, but here
you can read some of them for free.
I also have some books which were too big to upload here. They are represented in drive links.
